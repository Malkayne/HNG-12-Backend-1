# Number Classification API

## Project Description
This API provides mathematical properties of a given number and returns an interesting fun fact. It supports various number properties such as:
- Prime number check
- Perfect number check
- Armstrong number check
- Even or Odd classification
- The sum of the digits

Additionally, it fetches a fun fact about the number from the Numbers API.

## Features
- **GET** request with a number parameter.
- Returns mathematical properties of the number (prime, perfect, Armstrong, even/odd).
- Fetches a fun fact related to the number from the Numbers API.
- Validates the input and returns appropriate error messages for invalid input.

## API Endpoint
### Endpoint URL
```
GET /api/classify-number?number=<number>
```

### Example Request
```
GET https://yourdomain.com/api/classify-number?number=371
```

### Example Response (200 OK)
```json
{
    "number": 371,
    "is_prime": false,
    "is_perfect": false,
    "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
    "digit_sum": 11,
    "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}
```

### Example Response (400 Bad Request)
```json
{
    "number": "alphabet",
    "error": true
}
```

### Parameters
- **number** (required): The number to classify. Must be a valid integer.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-classification-api.git
   cd number-classification-api
   ```

2. **Set up the server**:
   Ensure you have **XAMPP** or any PHP server installed and running. Place the project folder in your server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP).

3. **Start Apache** in your XAMPP control panel.

4. **Test the API** by opening the following URL in your browser or Postman:
   ```
   http://localhost/number-classification-api/classify-number.php?number=371
   ```

## Deployment

To deploy the API to a public server, use any of the following hosting platforms:
- [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/)

Once deployed, update your API endpoint base URL in the example request.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP** for backend logic
- **Numbers API** for fetching fun facts
- **XAMPP** for local development and testing
